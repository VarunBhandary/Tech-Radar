"C#",adopt,"Languages and Frameworks",true,"<a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/'>C#</a> is our language of choice. It's strongly-typed, blends functional and object-oriented programming and works on all the OS we need to support."

"Java",trial,"Languages and Frameworks",true,"Redgate purchased Flyway, written in <a href='https://www.oracle.com/java/'>Java</a>. Java is a plausible choice for new products (due to its rich ecosystem), but we default to C#."
"Blazor.Net",assess,"Languages and Frameworks",true,"<a href='https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor'>Blazor</a> is super exciting. It means we might get to leverage our existing C# skills in the browser. It's too early for Redgate to commit to using this in production, so it's in assess so we can keep a good understanding of developments in this area."

"Terraform",adopt,"Tools",true,"Used for automating infrastucture provisioning."
"Docker",adopt,"Tools",true,"Docker should be used as the default containerisation technology. Used for building, testing and deployment."
"Containerised products",assess,"Techniques",true,"Where possible, all new products should be built to be containerised. We should ship the Mac/Linux versions of our products inside Docker containers."
"gRPC",trial,"Tools",true,"<a href='https://grpc.io/'>gRPC</a> is a high-performance RPC framework which we may investigate for high-volume data collection (for example, SQL Monitor)."
"Azure DevOps",trial,"Tools",true,"We believe Azure DevOps might be a fine alternative to TeamCity."
"WhiteSource (vulnerability scanning)",trial,"Tools",true,"We currently use WhiteSource for vulnerability scanning. This is currently under review."
"DocFx",trial,"Tools",true,"<a href='https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/'>DocFX</a> is an extensible and scalable static documentation generator. We're experimenting with it for the <a href='https://progression-framework.red-gate.com'>web version of the progression framework</a>. Could this be a future solution to host our documentation too?"
"GitHub Actions",assess,"Tools",true,"We're keeping an eye on GitHub actions as part of simplifying our build process."
"Makefiles",assess,"Tools",true,"Should we fall back to using Makefiles as part of a simpler build process? Again, this is part of our desire to simplify our build process."
"Earthly",assess,"Tools",true,"TODO Peter"
"Feature Flagging vendors (Launch Darkly?)",assess,"Tools",true,"If your usage of feature flagging becomes sufficiently complicated then it's time to investigate third-party vendors."
"Cake",assess,"Tools",true,"TODO Andrea"
"Bazel",assess,"Tools",true,"TODO Chris H"
"Raygun",hold,"Tools",true,"Deprecated in favour of Application Insights"
"Virtualbox based Vagrant boxes",hold,"Tools",true,"Use Docker instead where possible. UI and manual testing may still use Virtualbox."
"Keepass files in GitHub",hold,"Tools",true,"Use a password manager (or Vault) instead."
"Redgate.Build",hold,"Tools",true,"Redgate.Build is our own PowerShell based build scripts. Over time it's become complicated and we wouldn't recommend it for new projects."

"PostgreSQL",trial,"Platforms",true,"If there's a very good reason to use a lightweight/free database engine, we should choose Postgres."
"Virtual Machines",hold,"Platforms",true,"Prefer using lightweight Docker containers."
"Infrastructure as code",adopt,"Techniques",true,"Infrastructure should be provisioned through code rather than manually (except for ad-hoc testing)"
"Static code analysis",trial,"Techniques",true,"We think static analysis can be valuable but our SonarQube implementation wasn't giving us confidence. We should find a better solution."
"Semantic Versioning",adopt,"Techniques",true,"We should use semver for all our versioning needs unless there's a compelling reason not to"
"Database Agnosticism",adopt,"Techniques",true,"We aim for feature parity between products that support different database engines"
"Feature Flags",adopt,"Techniques",true,"Feature Flags are a great technique for minimizing long-lived feature branches. Our recommendation is to focus on simplicity - if you find yourself writing substantial code to support Feature Flags, consider using a third-party solution."
"Automated code style settings",adopt,"Techniques",true,"Codebases should be formatted consistently. Automated code-style settings achieve this without fuss."
"Continuous delivery",adopt,"Techniques",true,"Products should be ready for release at any time."
"Build inside Docker containers",trial,"Techniques",true,"We should reduce build dependencies by building and testing our products inside containers."
"Continuous Deployment",assess,"Techniques",true,"We'd like to evaluate technology that increases our deployment frequency, with a view to getting value into the hands of our users as quickly as possible."
