# Tech-Radar

A Tech Radar for Redgate. This helps us by recognizing the technology that:
* We use
* We're trialing and building experience
* We're excited about!
* We used to use and use no longer.

We use [Thoughtworks Tech Radar](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/) to generate our Tech Radar. The radar is backed by a single CSV file (that should nicely [render](https://help.github.com/articles/rendering-csv-and-tsv-data/)). All changes to the Tech Radar should be completed via a PR and merged by someone else.

You can see the [latest version online](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?sheetId=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fred-gate%2FTech-Radar%2Fmaster%2Fradar.csv).

We can have [multiple radars for different contexts](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?sheetId=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fred-gate%2FTech-Radar%2Fmaster%2Fsmaller-context.csv) if they are useful. Maybe a separate radar for desktop and server-bound tools would be useful alongside a global overview?

Please note this is public!
