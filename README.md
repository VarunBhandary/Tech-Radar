# Tech-Radar

A Tech Radar for Redgate.

This repository is currently in prototype state. Nothing in here is binding (yet).

There seem to be two technologies for building a tech radar.

* In the `src` folder. Served over HTTP this uses d3 to visualize it.
* Thoughtworks takes a CSV file (see `radar.csv`) and [renders it](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?sheetId=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fred-gate%2FTech-Radar%2Fmaster%2Fradar.csv)

Our current task is choosing that technology. See Issue #3
